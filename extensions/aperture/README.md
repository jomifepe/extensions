# Aperture

Record you screen directly from Raycast

# Acknowledgements

This extension uses and is inspired by tools like:
- [aperture](https://github.com/wulkano/aperture) - The same recorder used in [Kap](https://github.com/wulkano/Kap)
- [aperture-none](https://github.com/wulkano/aperture-node) - Node wrapper around aperture, in which I based my code on.

Thanks to the authors of these tools ❤️
