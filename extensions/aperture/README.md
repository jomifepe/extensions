## Preferences

Command where you're able to configure the recording options such as frames per second, show cursor, highlight clicks, video codec, etc.

# Development

## Native modules

-  `aperture-cli` - Native screen recorder. This binary is the output of the `build:aperture-cli` command, which builds the Swift CLI application from [aperture-none](https://github.com/wulkano/aperture-node).
-  `aperture-indicator` - Native macOS application that shows a menu bar indicator when the screen is being recorded. This app can be built by running the `build:aperture-indicator` command. Its source code is located in the [Sources/aperture-indicator](Sources/aperture-indicator/) directory.

# Acknowledgements

This extension uses and is inspired by tools like:

-  [aperture](https://github.com/wulkano/aperture) - The same recorder used in [Kap](https://github.com/wulkano/Kap)
-  [aperture-none](https://github.com/wulkano/aperture-node) - Node wrapper around aperture, in which I based my code on.

Thanks to the authors of these tools ‚ù§Ô∏è
